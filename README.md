#### ⟾ Numerical simulation of acoustic levitation thanks to the matrix method

This project is part of my TIPE (travail d'initiative personnelle encadré) on the subject of acoustic levitation.

To test the various aspects of this phenomena and to see what's not visible, a simulation was necessary.

This repository implements the matrix method used in the publication ["Matrix Method for Acoustic Levitation Simulation"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224254694_Matrix_Method_for_Acoustic_Levitation_Simulation).

The core of this repo is heavely inspired by [slkiser's](https://github.com/slkiser) implementation of the matrix method done in python, it only cover the section II of the paper but is an excellent start to understand how the algorithm works outside of theory.
